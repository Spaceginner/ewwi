# eww.

the disgusting language.

## why is it so ugly?

pure functions are impossible. the compiler **rejects** any attempts at pure functions, and warns if the functions returns a value.

## eso?

yeah

## syntax?

`W.I.P.`

for now just look around the `lib/` or `example_scripts/` to get the feeling of it.
